Okay, at this moment of time you might be thinking what is the actual use of getting to know about these version history, let me tell you that selection of targetted audience is a major task in the beginning of the development. Which indirectly leads you to here to check which android version that you want to keep the base as. 

Remember that although you might be even choosing the least of all android version to target the 100% of audience but let me tell you this, when to get down the least of targetting total audience you might have get compramised with things which are nont available in older versions. 

1. In 2004, the Android OS was developed with the backing of Google by Android Inc. In 2005, Google paid $50 million for the OS.

2. Originally the Android OS wasn’t designed for the smartphone market; it was actually developed as a digital camera platform.

3. Android has over a billion activations on devices including tablets and of course smartphones from all around the world.

4. Android is actually open-source which means that individuals have the option to modify source code of the OS and manufacturers can add features. So if you are an entusiast to do such kind of stuff then you will be on your way to develop the next future OS for the world market. ( This makes android phones flexible to load custom ROM in them if you have proper knowledge )

5. The word ‘Android’ actually means a human with a male robot appearance. And in the recent releases in the game market we have a game which has this special Android named robot character.

6. In California in 2003, Andy Rubin, Nick Sears and Chris White founded Android Inc.

7. NASA even uses Android. They sent 2 Nexus S handsets running Android Gingerbread into space to test their sensors in orbit aboard
the International Space Station. Probably the first android devices to be in space.

8. Android is available in around 46 languages, this also means apps can be produced in different languages to cover a wider audience. In countries like India where there is a diverse culture and being from different states having own language its a good challenge for android to actually support the native local languages.

9. Android’s app store “Google Play” has over 48 billion app installs. Which is not a small number at all.

10. Android’s logo isn’t actually called Android, Google unof×cially call him Bugdroid.
